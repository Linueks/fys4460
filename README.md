# Fys4460
Work done in fys4460: Unordered Systems and Percolation at UiO spring 2021. Links to the projects should be available at https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/fys/FYS4460/v21/notes/projects.html might download the project texts later.

## Project 1: Atomic Modelling of Liquid
Intro to molecular dynamics simulations using LAMMPS for the simulation and OVITO for the visualization. We studied the Lennard-Jones potential for Argon gases in different configurations. The project is not 100% completed, and there should be better run examples etc.

## Project 2: Atomic Modelling of Nano-Porous Materials
Continuation of the work done in Project 1. We generated randomized porous materials and calculated various macroscopic parameters of the materials from the microcanonical ensamble. 

## Project 3: Percolation
This project is an introduction to the study of percolation of unordered systems. The work here ties back to the nano-porous materials generated in the final tasks in Project 2. Here we are in some ways looking at collections of systems generated in Project 2, if I've not completely misunderstood the approach.

## Project 4: Not Done
